# Grid_vs_Point_Friday
Friday project

This is the work that I have done in the final day of a software workshop with other persons. 

It can do two jobs: one is downloading the point rainfall data collected by many stations in UK and trying to plot them;
the other is import the downloaded grid data of rainfall from txt file into matrix and plot them.
